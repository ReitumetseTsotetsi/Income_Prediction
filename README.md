### **General Info**

Retail banking is the visible face of banking to the general public, with bank branches located in abundance in most major cities. In retail banking, understanding customer behaviour is a critical part of planning for and meeting customers’ needs.
The objective of this challenge is to create a machine learning solution to predict a customer’s income, based on their transaction history over a fourteen-month period.
This solution will enable Absa to anticipate their customers’ needs, and allow them to offer optimal solutions to their customers.
The transaction data is over a period of 14 months, running from the start of July 2021 to the end of August 2022.

### **Features**

Numerical Features
Categorical features
Visualizations:
We used visually appealing charts, graphs, and tables to represent the data and uncover patterns or trends.
Filters, cards and Slicers:
We applied filters and slicers to focus on specific subsets of data and enable interactive exploration.

## **Setup**

Data Preparation:
EDA: data cleaning (duplicates, nulls, empty, converting data types, imputing/replcing nulls)
STATISTICS: feature selection, check linearity, multi collinearity,outliers, variance threshold, correlation.
MODEL BUILDING : (train/test split, data scaling(standard scaler), fit the model (linear regression), predict, assess the model(desicion tree, random forest, Lasso, Ridge)

## **Project status**
In Progress

## **Room for improvement**
still need to apply UI on our Task
